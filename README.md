# Diabetes-Prediction-using-Artificial-Neural-Network-ANN-with-PC
This project implements an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) using the MLPClassifier from scikit-learn to predict diabetes based on the Pima Indians Diabetes dataset. The dataset includes 8 features such as glucose level, blood pressure, BMI, and age, with a binary target variable indicating the presence or absence of diabetes.
